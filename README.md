# LiteServer
Super lite webserver intended to deliver static content and FCGI connections.

## Thanks
APACHE for the original idea in mod_fcgi.

NGINX and WireShark that a have used as a model for the FCGI interface.

## Disclaimer

The project is in a really early stage of development, more as a learning tool than really intended to be used in production.

It support static files basically and the connection with PHP-FPM is partilly implemented.

## TODO

  - Implement correct headers sent to PHP
